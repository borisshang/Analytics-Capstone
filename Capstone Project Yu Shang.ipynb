    "### In conclusion, it shows that there is a positive correlation bewtween the number of criminal participants and the number of victims. Which may indicate some gang conflicts and should be better controled by US government to decrease the number of the victims. In this case, the dependent variable is the number of victims and the independent variable is the number of criminal participants. One point is worth mentioning is that, China regulate guns and weapons strictly with laws, it is illegal to possess a gun, whereas people can buy guns with gun license over 21 in united state. I searched that it is lawful to buy a gun with a gun license over 21, but there is no detail declaring the age of possess of the gun, and this will bring market and opportunities for teenagers to access the guns without permission and a right way of using it."
